# Chrome Extension (Manifest V3) Guidelines

## Project Structure

- Keep a clean directory structure with separate folders for:
  - `src/`: Source code
  - `public/`: Static assets
  - `dist/`: Build output (generated)

## Manifest Guidelines

- Always use the latest Manifest V3 format
- Specify minimum required permissions only
- Use declarativeNetRequest instead of webRequest where possible
- Implement service workers instead of background pages
- Use content_scripts for page interactions

## Security Best Practices

- Implement strict Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Use host permissions instead of all_urls when possible
- Sanitize any user input
- Avoid eval() and inline scripts
- Use storage.local instead of localStorage

## Performance Guidelines

- Keep service workers lightweight
- Minimize DOM operations in content scripts
- Use event-driven architecture
- Implement proper cleanup in your scripts
- Lazy-load resources when possible

## Development Workflow

- Use a modern build system (webpack, rollup, etc.)
- Implement hot-reloading for development
- Write unit tests for core functionality
- Follow semantic versioning

## Code Style

- Use consistent naming conventions
- Document public APIs and complex functions
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Keep functions small and focused

## Accessibility

- Ensure UI elements have proper ARIA attributes
- Support keyboard navigation
- Test with screen readers
- Use sufficient color contrast

## Internationalization

- Externalize user-facing strings
- Support RTL languages if applicable
- Use Chrome's i18n API

## Debugging

- Use Chrome's extension debugging tools
- Implement proper error handling
- Add logging in development builds
